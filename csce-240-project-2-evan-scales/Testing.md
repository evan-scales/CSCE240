# Testing your Code for Project 2
This time around you will have 2 ways that you can test your code locally on your machine. You can test them with a main that has Google Tests enabled or one that does not. Note that even if you decide to just use the non-gtest enabled mains, you should run your code with the GTest mains at some point to figure out your grade!
